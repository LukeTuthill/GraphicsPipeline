CS 334 HW 1
I attempted the Pong game extra credit, it is in pong.cpp, with keypresses handled by the framebuffer, and scoring handled by the scene. Up/down arrow for left player, left/right arrow for right player.

Change the choice variable in Scene::DBG to choose between pong (0), the name video (1), or saving the name to a file (2).
